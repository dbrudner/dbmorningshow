- Learn CLI basics https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101*
  - Any udemy or YT course, theres millions. I can't think of any that stand out
  - We're learning just enough of this shit so we can use git, node, and npm
- Learn git https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/*
  -Same as CLI basics
- FCC FE Libraries Projects - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects
  - Use anything, but I would recommend vanilla
- Deploy projects through github pages or any other static hosting provider
- Continue learning javascript

  - The other ones in this are great too, but these are the ones that matter most
  - I just found this and it looks pretty fucking solid honestly https://javascript.info/
  - Use this extensively https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
  - Async JS & Learn to make a request (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function
    - Make a weather app
    - Make something with one of these learning APIs:
      - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ (render a list, table, etc)
      - https://pokeapi.co/ (build a searchable pokedex)
- Learn node

  - FCC's node stuff doesn't look great imo
  - Prob learn express first, maybe nest but that's more involved
- Learn SQL/Mongo or some other database
  - Just super basics. You just need to be able to read and write shit if you're doing front end, don't have to go nuts here because you prob won't be doing this much daily, but it will hugely enhance the projects you can make on your own.
- Learn react

  - https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react
  - Make small react app -- bitcoin/crypto tracker
  - Learn to serve react app over express/node server
  -
  - Learn either redux or react context

- Pull it all together ane make something dope
- Going further (Past this point is prob extra)
- Transpilers (babel)
- Compilers (webpack, parcel, rollup, the other ones)
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Functional Programming
- OOP
- Testing
  - Unit, integrated, e2e
- Versioning and library management/open source contribution
- Data viz (d3)

- CSS
  - Don't worry too much about learning CSS on its own. Learn it as you need it for the shit you build. That's the only way I've been able to get better at CSS.

Things you will need to know/use

1. VSCode
2. MDN
3. Chrome devtools

Things I wouldn't recommend

1. Reading a book before learning for a couple months
2. Spending too much time learning CSS. That'll come in time as you need it when you build shit.
3. Memorizing things. Just get a basic idea of things and move on.
